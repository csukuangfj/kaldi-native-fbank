  // same sequence of numbers that rand() will give if you keep calling rand()
  // after that initial call.  This can cause problems with repeated sequences.
  // For example if you initialize two RandomState structs one after the other
  // without calling rand() in between, they would give you the same sequence
  // offset by one (if we didn't have the "+ 27437" in the code).  27437 is just
  // a randomly chosen prime number.
